# GenesisCA 
- IDE of modeling and simulation of Cellular Automata (CA)
- Focused on creation and evaluation of new CA models, by experimentation
- Based on Visual Programming Language (VPL) to define the rules
- First version will contain support to define CA models with:
  - *Cell attributes types:* [Bool, Integer, Float] Cell attributes define the informations each cell is holding.
  - *Model attributes types:* [Bool, Integer, Float] Model attributes define the parameters of CA model used on cell update rules that can be tuned when used the exported CA model.
  - *Neighborhood:* user is free to define the number of neighborhoods, and it's layout
  - *Rule definitions:* user design your own algorithm using VPL, to defines the way attributes updated, input colors are interpreted, and output colors are modified.
  - *Color input mapping:* user can create mappings for define what to do with the cell attributes given a color. This can be used to allow image initializations, as well as interactions at simulation time.
  - *Color output mapping:* user is able to creates different modes of visualization, mapping the cell attribute configurations into colors. This could be userful for debugging, presenting, or artistic purposes.
