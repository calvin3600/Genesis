# GenesisCA 
- Interface to aid the study and creation of Cellular Automata (CA)
- Focused on creation of new CA models, by experimentation
- Based on Visual Programing Language (VPL)
- Supporting:
  - *Different cell attributes:* Bool, Numerical, User Defined
  - *Different neighborhoods:* user defines the shape and the number of neighborhoods
  - *Different Partitions:* especially useful to Block CAs
  - *Arbitrary rule definitions:* user design your own algorithm that defines the way attributes are updated, using VPL
  - *Arbitrary input mapping:* defines ways to give a input to your model, as random, mapping the values of an image, etc...
  - *Arbitrary output mapping:* user is able to creates different modes of visualization, mapping attributes into colors
